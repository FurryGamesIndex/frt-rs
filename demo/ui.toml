<p>FGI (short for FurryGamesIndex) is a project to collect, organize, classify, tag games which are "furry games" or include furry and/or kemono contents. Also collect third-party localized resource links for these games.</p>
<p>The motive for creating this project was that Lucky Doge gave up his <a href="https://doge.im/recommend/kemono-games.html">Furry Game Collection</a> project, and Utopic Panther once benefited from the project of Lucky Doge, and trying to rebuild a game collection on the Internet. Lucky Doge <a href="https://github.com/FurryGamesIndex/games/blob/master/luckydoge.txt">generously provided the results that he had made a lot of hard work</a>, making it possible for this project to quickly develop into a practical list.</p>
<p>We want you to be part of this project. <a href="https://github.com/FurryGamesIndex/games/tree/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md">get involved now</a>.</p>
